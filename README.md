This Windows Console Application, written in C++, is a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs on the Windows Command Line. The user plays the game by entering responses to text-based prompts. The user can choose to play as either Xs or Os, and can choose to either close the application or rematch the AI opponent at the end of each round. The game also includes a score counter for the number of games won by either player (Human user & AI).

The interesting aspect of the game design is that the artificial opponent is unbeatable. Since Tic-Tac-Toe is a solved zero-sum game, I've implemented a recursive minimax algorithm which simulates all possible outcomes of the game resulting from each move available to the artificial opponent each turn. By scoring each simulated outcome as positive/negative/zero based on whether it's a win/loss/draw for the artifical opponent, and summating those scores, the artificial opponent is able to calculate the optimal move each turn. To keep the gameplay dynamic, I've randomized the opponent's decision-making process between available moves that the algorithm scores as equally optimal.

The program is currently only desgined to be run on Windows. 
You can run the program by simply cloning/downloading the repository and running the .cpp file.
