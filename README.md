This Windows Console Application, written in C++, is a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs on the Windows Command Line. The user plays the game by entering responses to text-based prompts. The user can choose to play as either Xs or Os, and can choose to either close the application or rematch the AI opponent at the end of each round. The game also includes a score counter for the number of games won by either player (Human user & AI).

The interesting aspect of the game design is that the AI opponent is unbeatable. Since Tic-Tac-Toe is a solved zero-sum game, I've implemented a recursive minimax algorithm which essentially simulates all possible outcomes of the game which could result from each possible decision the AI could make for any given turn. By scoring each simulated outcome as positive/negative/zero based on whether it's a win/loss/draw for the AI, and summating those scores, the AI is able to calculate the optimal move each turn under the assumption that the user is also playing optimally. To keep the gameplay dynamic, I've randomized the AI's decision-making process between moves calculated by the algorithm to have equivalent scores.

The program is currently only desgined to be run on Windows. 
You can run the program by simply cloning/downloading the repository and running the .sln file. Alternatively, the source code (source.cpp) is located in the repository folder named "Tic-Tac-Toe".
